- Expected: Improved accessibility scores

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it
3. **Mobile Ready**: Fully responsive design tested
4. **Accessibility Compliant**: WCAG guidelines followed
5. **Performance Optimized**: Minimal impact on page load times

## ðŸ”„ ROLLBACK PLAN

If issues arise, rollback involves:
1. Remove the new JavaScript file: `static/js/tax-calculator-realtime.js`
2. Revert template changes in `templates/tax/tax_calculator.html`
3. Keep translation key additions (they don't break anything)

## âœ¨ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

All changes have been implemented and are ready for deployment. The enhancements provide significant user experience improvements while maintaining full backward compatibility and system stability.
